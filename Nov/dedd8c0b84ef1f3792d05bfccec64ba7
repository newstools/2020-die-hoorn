The Western Cape Government today has issued an urgent hotspot alert for the Garden Route District, due to the rapidly increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the area. This spike is mainly contributing to the notable growth of active cases in the Western Cape. The Greater Oudtshoorn and Kannaland form part of this district. Specifically concerning are the increasing number of cases in George, Knysna and Bitou. George, which currently has 628 active cases, the highest number of active cases in the province. Over the weekend there were 160 new cases in George; 145 new cases in Knysna/Bitou; 41 new cases in Mossel Bay and 7 new cases in Hessequa. Along with the increasing number of cases in the region, the number of hospitalisations also has increased. According to the premier of the Western Cape, Alan Winde, the hotspot team for the Garden Route has increased surveillance through screening and testing. “We are also working closely with the municipalities, environmental health teams, and stakeholders in the region to manage and contain the spread. This includes a concerted communications campaign in the area. We are also paying special attention to vulnerable groups, including old age homes,” he said. “We need every single resident of the Garden Route and visitors to the region to help us stop this surge by: wearing your mask at all times when out in public places; avoiding gatherings; avoiding crowded places, especially when there is poor ventilation; staying at least 1,5 metres apart and washing your hands with soap and water regularly “If you feel sick, stay at home and if you are experiencing symptoms, call the hotline on 080 928 4102 for directions and next steps. “We will only be able to bring this situation under control if everyone takes responsibility now.”
