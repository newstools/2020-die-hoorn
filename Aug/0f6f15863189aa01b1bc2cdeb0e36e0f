WHILE there are promising signs of a decline in Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths in some parts of the Western Cape, the Garden Route is still recording an increase in the numbers of infections and hospitalisations, says Alan Winde, Western Cape premier.Oudtshoorn and Kannaland form part of the Garden Route District.“As a result, we are experiencing increased pressure on our healthcare systems in the Garden Route region, specifically in the demand for high care and ICU treatment.“We believe that many areas across the province are at different stages in their infection curve and the Garden Route may not yet have reached its peak. It is therefore important that we all continue to work hard to ensure that we can slow the spread across the entire province.“The Western Cape Government is committed to ensuring that we are able to manage this peak in the same way we managed the peak in the Metro and will be applying lessons learned, and boosting resources to the region.“The Western Cape Department of Health will therefore be allocating additional resources to hospitals in the region – including additional staff and the equipment necessary to administer high flow nasal oxygen. Oudsthoorn and Knsyna hospitals have already received equipment which is in use.“Our hotspot interventions also continue in this region. Some of these include increased communications in communities using radio, street pole posters, and loudhailing. Public and high traffic areas are also being sanitized and EPWP workers have been assigned to ensure social distancing in public places.Two provincial ministers will visit the region. The Minister of Transport and Public Works, Bonginkosi Madikizela, will visit the region over the long weekend and will amongst others conduct roadblocks in Bitou, Knysna and George, and check that long distance taxis are complying with the 70% loading regulations.The Minister of Health, Nomafrench Mbombo, has scheduled a four day visit to the region for next week.
