THE Garden Route District Municipality (GRDM) announced the death of a third employee to Covid-19. Nono Willie Nkasayi (54), a senior worker at the GRDM Oudtshoorn Roads Services Department, passed away on Friday (28 August 2020). Nkasayi worked in the Oudtshoorn region since 3 June 2005. Gert Verwey, deputy manager at the Oudtshoorn region, described him as a man who has always treated everyone with respect, and who had the ability to look at the “bigger picture” of things in life. “He was an exceptional person – well-known as a God-fearing person, and as a pastor at his church, a prominent religious leader in the Southern Cape and Karoo area.” Kleinbooi Stoffels, roads services superintendent and the immediate supervisor of Nkasayi,  said that he will be deeply missed amongst his colleagues.  “His passing really shocked me, and made me realise how short life is and that we should appreciate each other while we still can.” Nkasayi was a union representative at the GRDM for the South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU).
