The Cango Wildlife Ranch in Oudtshoorn these days are void of any visitors, children excitedly running from enclosure to enclosure to see the animals, and the chatter of guides education people on the different species. This well-known tourism attraction housing tigers, cheetahs, lions and close to 90 other species has been severely affected by the lockdown, but has to keep going for the sake of the animals. The Ranch has reached out to the public for assistance – financial or any other way of donating. “The ranch has more than 100 hectares of land, which is enclosed by electrical fencing,” said Tammy Moult, marketing director. “Electricity is not only needed to keep the lights on, but to keep heat lamps going, enclosures safe and animals in their cages. “Any form of food donations will also be appreciated, and will lighten the financial load. “All our animals have specialised diet sheets, and they not only differ morning to evening, but day to day and for each season,” Moult explains. “To put this into perspective, the ranch uses about 30 kg of apples each week. “Meat is needed for the predators, and with it being hunting season, any farmer or hunter who can donate, can make a huge difference.” Moult says the animals seem to miss the public too. “Our cheetahs love human interaction, and whenever they see us, they literally talk to us, rolling around and being cute so we give them some extra enrichment.” (By Angelique Erasmus)
