Wearing masks and social distancing I live in West Bank and drive through the town centre, Bridgton and Bongolethu every couple of days.It is apparent that in the town centre shopping areas 90% of the people wear masks and attempt to socially distance. Away from the town centre this isn’t the case.In Bridgton last evening I’d estimate only 10 to 20% of people in public spaces had masks on and I could see no evidence of social distancing at all. Lots of teenagers were milling about in groups of two to 10 on the streets.Whatever we are doing to get people to behave properly re preventing the virus spreading isn’t working in what is a looming, deadly crisis.How can we get people in our community to behave in a responsible fashion?Can our elected officials, community leaders, churches, radio stations, newspapers, clinics, propagate the message that these simple measures are really important?Can SAPS encourage compliance further without criminalising matters?Can relevant people get together and come up with an effective co-ordinated plan, please? – Dr Barry McGurk, Oudtshoorn
