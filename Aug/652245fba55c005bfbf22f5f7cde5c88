Nearly four years after a provincial forensic investigation into the Kannaland Municipality was undertaken, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has taken a decision to formally charge two former senior officials of the municipality. The Western Cape Minister of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, Anton Bredell, has welcomed the news. “The wheels of justice grind slow but fine. We are pleased to see the NPA taking this step and look forward to seeing an end to this matter as soon as possible. I want to repeat my call on the national government to strengthen and better capacitate the law enforcement agencies in the Western Cape, so that these investigations can be completed much faster.” Bredell says the initial provincial forensic investigation started in early 2017, and was followed up by an investigation by the Hawks. This has now led to the NPA decision. “To the people of Kannaland we want to say that we have delivered on our promise to pursue accountable and clean government and to hold people accountable for their actions. To other councils and officials in the province who think they can get away with crime and corruption, I want to say we will come for you and we will not stop no matter how long it takes.” Bredell is calling on anyone with concerns or evidence of wrongdoing to report such concerns to the South African Police for investigation. “In the Western Cape we are intent to stamp out corruption no matter where it leads and no matter what it takes.”
