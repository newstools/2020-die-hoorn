IN a bid to lessen rising crimes the South African Parliament has once again given a go ahead to the SAPS to reopen a window for a firearm amnesty.The project was halted by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the country going into Level 5 of the lockdown.A window of six months has yet again opened for a firearm amnesty from 1 August 2020 to 31 January 2021, either for the destruction of the weapons or for the renewal of a competency certificate and a valid licence.Over 46 714 firearms were surrendered during the December 2019 to May 2020 amnesty, hence the call to yet another round of actioning for the surrendering of firearms. According to a press statement of the SAPS it should be noted that no indemnity will be granted for firearms used to commit any crime.
