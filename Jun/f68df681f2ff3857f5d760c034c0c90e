Thank you! On 4 June 2020 I, Linda, filled up my car at the Shell Garage in Ladismith. When I used my SASSA card to pay, it was declined, stating insufficient funds.My heart dropped realising that some­how this monthly payment had not been paid into my account this month, why I don’t know.I had not thought of checking my account first!When I explained the situation to the owner of the Shell Garage, Shaun Butler, this was his answer in response: “I feel that the Lord Jesus Christ is telling me to bless you Linda and I myself will pay it in for you, so that you know that there are people who care for another through all times and situations because of Jesus Christ in one’s life.”Shaun Butler then prayed for Abba Father’s blessings and provision to grow in my life. I was brought to tears of gratitude from the Godly humble love and kindness flowing from this young man.Thank you so much, Shaun Butler.May God’s face shine upon you always.– Linda, Ladismith Kom tot rus! Om die mensdom in sy weë te stuithet God toe besluitom die mense (wêreld) tydelik toe te sluit; Die winkels bly oop!Die treine, busse, taxi’s, die loop; As ons nié kom tot rusgaan “Covid-ry-ons” hééltemal uitwis! Soos ons in “Die Woord” lees:Laat ons gehoorsaam wees. En: Máák soos God sê!Dis waar die antwoord lê! Sela– Cecile Ungerer, Oudtshoorn
